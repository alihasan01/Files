/**
 * * A Segment1d is an interval of an axis named x.
 * * The interval is defined by two values x0 and x1.
 * * The x0 and x1 values can be in either order.
 * * * if `x0 < x1` fractional coordinates within the segment move from left to right.
 * * * if `x0 > x1` fractional coordinatesw within the segment move from right to left.
 * * This differs from a Range1d in that:
 * * For a Range1d the reversed ordering of its limit values means "empty interval".
 * * For a Segment1d the reversed ordering is a real interval but fractional positions mvoe backwards.
 * * The segment is parameterized with a fraction
 * * * Fraction 0 is the start (`x0`)
 * * * Fraction 1 is the end (`x1`)
 * * * The fraction equation is `x = x0 + fraction * (x1-x0)` or (equivalently) `x = (1-fraction) * x0 + fraction * x1`
