/**
 * An AngleSweep is a pair of angles at start and end of an interval.
 *
 * *  For stroking purposes, the "included interval" is all angles numerically reached by theta = start + f*(end-start), where f is between 0 and 1.
 * *  This stroking formula is simple numbers -- 2PI shifts are not involved.
 * *  2PI shifts do become important in the reverse mapping of an angle to a fraction.
 * *  If (start < end) the angle proceeds CCW around the unit circle.
 * *  If (end < start) the angle proceeds CW around the unit circle.
 * *  Angles beyond 360 are fine as endpoints.
 *
 * **  (350,370) covers the same unit angles as (-10,10).
 * **  (370,350) covers the same unit angles as (10,-10).
