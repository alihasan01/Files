 *
 * * A HalfEdge is "one side of an edge" in a structure of faces, edges and vertices.  From a node there are navigational links to:
 * ** "faceSuccessor" -- the next half edge in a loop around a face.
 * ** "facePredecessor" -- the previous half edge in a loop around a face.
 * ** "edgeMate"  -- the node's partner on the other side of the edge.
 * * The next, prev, and mate are the essential connectivity.  Additional node content is for application-specific
 *     uses.  The most useful ones are:
 * ** x,y -- coordinates in the xy plane
 * ** z -- z coordinate.  This is normally ignored during planar setup, but used for output.
 * ** buffer -- a integer value manipulated as individual bits.
 * * In properly connected planar graph, interior face loops are counterclockwise.  But that property (along with
 *      expected masking) is a result of extensive validation of inputs, and is not true in intermediate phases
 *      of graph manipulation.
