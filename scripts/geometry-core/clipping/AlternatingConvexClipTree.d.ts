/**
 * An AlternatingConvexClipTreeNode is a node in a tree structure in which
 *   <ul>
 *   <li>Each node contains a ConvexClipPlaneSet
 *   <li>Each node contains an array of children which are also AlternativingConvexClipTreeNode.
 *   <li>The rule for an in/out decision is that a point is IN the subtree under a node if
 *   <ul>
 *   <li>It is IN the node's ConvexClipPlaneSet.
 *   <li>It is NOT IN any of the children.
 *   </ul>
 *   <li>Applying "NOT IN any of the children" locally to children at each level means that the ConvexClipPlaneSet
 *       at adjacent levels flip between being positive areas and holes.
 *   <li>Use an AlternatingConvexClipTreeNodeBuilder to construct the tree from a polygon.
 *   <li>It is possible for the root clip plane set to be empty.  An empty clip plane set returns "true"
 *         for all point tests, so the meaning is just that holes are to be subtracted from the rest
 *         of space.
 *   <li>Althogh the interpretation of in/out alternates with tree levels, the ConvexClipPlaneSets
 *         at each level are all "enclosing" planes in the usual way.
 *   </ul>
